TODO´s:

- For the license.json, it’s great that you can hide certain things from the warehouse. Here, I would suggest adding the option to purchase licenses from two different shops. One in the city for things like food/mining/etc., and the second with a separate menu for cocaine and other similar items. That would be super convenient!
toggle on/off duty
- What should be changed would be the On/Off duty feature for cops, medical personnel, etc. It can be easily abused with Ctrl+3, and I don't really see its purpose. How could a player realistically get from point X to station X in less than 3 seconds?
- It would be better if every station/department/etc. had a model for a device or terminal, and from there, you could toggle On/Off duty, which would also spawn you at the location where you toggled On/Off duty.
