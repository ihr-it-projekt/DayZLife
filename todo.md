TODOÂ´s:

- For the license.json, itâ€™s great that you can hide certain things from the warehouse. Here, I would suggest adding the option to purchase licenses from two different shops. One in the city for things like food/mining/etc., and the second with a separate menu for cocaine and other similar items. That would be super convenient!
- toggle on/off duty
  - What should be changed would be the On/Off duty feature for cops, medical personnel, etc. It can be easily abused with Ctrl+3, and I don't really see its purpose. How could a player realistically get from point X to station X in less than 3 seconds?
  - It would be better if every station/department/etc. had a model for a device or terminal, and from there, you could toggle On/Off duty, which would also spawn you at the location where you toggled On/Off duty.
    i saw this, ok. thx for reply. one more thing what i think it s better.
- possibility to remove licenses or check license by cops
- It would be great to add a setting where, for example, police officers cannot rob, especially when they are on duty.ðŸ˜©
- Can it be added to the trader so that it also gives dzl_blackmoney? I was thinking of setting it up so that items like cocaine, etc., can be sold and provide dzl_blackmoney. Afterward, this could create an RP situation where only the members of the faction "test1" can sell the cash money to the trader. Once sold, the faction members would give the "laundered" money to the players.
